Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is coined from two distinctive words, 'software' and 'engineering' such that the union defines the art and science of designing, building, and maintaining a couple of programs (software) which has been carefully put together for a specific requirement using well-defined scientific principles and methods. Software Engineering is important as it makes things easy in all spheres of life like a simple machine. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The NATO Software Engineering Conference of 1968 recognized software engineering, identified software crises and called for an engineering approach.
The Development of object-oriented Program (OOP) which saw the introduction of OOP Concepts, improved modularity, and widespread adoption of the OOP Concept
The Agile Milestone of 2001 saw the encouragement of collaboration between developers, customers, and stakeholders

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Idea Generation: Software Developers first identify the problem, thereby identifying the key challenges, constraints, and goals.
Requirement Analysis: They then collect and analyze requirements from stakeholders and users, to understand the problem which is further broken down into smaller, manageable components, identifying key issues and prioritizing them.
Product Design: They generate potential solutions, considering multiple approaches, technologies, and trade-offs. They also access each solution's feasibility, effectiveness, and potential risks, selecting the most promising approach
Product Development: Software Engineers build prototypes, before designing, developing, and testing the software solution using programming languages and tools.
Integration and Testing: They conduct unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing
Deployment: Software Engineers deploy the solution to production, ensuring a smooth transition and minimal disruption.
Maintainance: They monitor the solution performance, address issues, and implement updates to ensure solutions continue to meet evolving needs.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Unlike the Agile milestone which was a progressive response to the limitations of the traditional waterfall development methodology, the waterfall was mostly rigid and inflexible posing a hindrance to collaborations between developers, customers, and stakeholders.
Scenarios for Waterfall include Safety-critical systems and a fixed budget timeline
Scenarios for Agile include rapidly changing requirements and highly collaborative teams

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Engineer: This is the expert tasked with the duty of designing, developing, and maintaining the software necessary for daily activities.
Quality Assurance Engineer: This is the expert who directly uses the software interface for daily activity. Usually regarded as the user essential during software testing.
Project Manager: The expert who identifies the problems, and then assigns them to the Software developer for solution.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 
 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines, that can be overcome by the agile development strategies.
Complex requirements that can be overcome by using domain-driven design.
Debugging and troubleshooting, that can be overcome by collaboration with colleagues

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
