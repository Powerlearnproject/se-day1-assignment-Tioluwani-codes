#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is coined from two distinctive words, 'software' and 'engineering' such that the union defines the art and science of designing, building, and maintaining a couple of programs (software) which has been carefully put together for a specific requirement using well-defined scientific principles and methods. Software Engineering is important as it makes things easy in all spheres of life like a simple machine. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The NATO Software Engineering Conference of 1968 recognized software engineering, identified software crises and called for an engineering approach.
The Development of object-oriented Program (OOP) which saw the introduction of OOP Concepts, improved modularity, and widespread adoption of the OOP Concept
The Agile Milestone of 2001 saw the encouragement of collaboration between developers, customers, and stakeholders

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Idea Generation: Software Developers first identify the problem, thereby identifying the key challenges, constraints, and goals.
Requirement Analysis: They then collect and analyze requirements from stakeholders and users, to understand the problem which is further broken down into smaller, manageable components, identifying key issues and prioritizing them.
Product Design: They generate potential solutions, considering multiple approaches, technologies, and trade-offs. They also access each solution's feasibility, effectiveness, and potential risks, selecting the most promising approach
Product Development: Software Engineers build prototypes, before designing, developing, and testing the software solution using programming languages and tools.
Integration and Testing: They conduct unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing
Deployment: Software Engineers deploy the solution to production, ensuring a smooth transition and minimal disruption.
Maintainance: They monitor the solution performance, address issues, and implement updates to ensure solutions continue to meet evolving needs.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Unlike the Agile milestone which was a progressive response to the limitations of the traditional waterfall development methodology, the waterfall was mostly rigid and inflexible posing a hindrance to collaborations between developers, customers, and stakeholders.
Scenarios for Waterfall include Safety-critical systems and a fixed budget timeline
Scenarios for Agile include rapidly changing requirements and highly collaborative teams

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Engineer: This is the expert tasked with the duty of designing, developing, and maintaining the software necessary for daily activities.
Quality Assurance Engineer: This is the expert who directly uses the software interface for daily activity. Usually regarded as the user essential during software testing.
Project Manager: The expert who identifies the problems, and then assigns them to the Software developer for solution.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs are software applications that provide a comprehensive development environment for writing, debugging, and testing code. The importance of IDEs lies in their ability to: Improve coding efficiency, enhance debugging capabilities, and support project management. Popular examples include Eclipse and Visual Studios.
VCS are software tools that help developers manage changes to their codebase over time. The importance of VCS lies in their ability to: Track changes, Collaborate on code, and manage different versions. Popular examples include Git, Mercurial, and Subversion.
 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Tight deadlines, that can be overcome by the agile development strategies.
Complex requirements that can be overcome by using domain-driven design.
Debugging and troubleshooting, that can be overcome by collaboration with colleagues

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing: Tests individual modules or functions in isolation. It ensures that the basic building blocks of software are functioning correctly.
Integration testing: tests how different modules interact with each other. It verifies that modules can work together seamlessly.
System testing: Tests the entire software system as a whole. It ensures that the software meets its functional and non-functional requirements.
Acceptance testing: Tests the software from the end-user's perspective. It vPerifies that the software meets the requirements defined by stakeholders.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt is a piece of text, voice, or image fed into a language model to generate natural language responses. Hence, Prompt Engineering is the process of crafting effective and informative text instructions or prompts to guide AI models in performing a desired task.
Enhances Model Accuracy: Well-crafted prompts provide the AI model with a specific understanding of the task, reducing ambiguity and improving the overall accuracy of its results.
Facilitates Communication: Clear and concise prompts facilitate smooth communication between humans and AI models, making it easier to convey complex instructions and receive intelligible responses.
Improves User Interface: Prompts act as the interface between the user and the AI model, enabling intuitive and user-friendly interactions.
Controls Model Bias: Prompts can influence the model's behavior by guiding it towards desired outcomes or mitigating biases present in the training data.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: What is the name of a US President?
Clear Prompt: What is the name of the first Black American President?
